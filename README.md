## How to Use

1. Well first of all, install all the requirements, won't work without it.
2. Download source code and run RUN.bat.

## Acknowledgment

Main code is highly inspired from [unity-texture-toolkit](https://github.com/esterTion/unity-texture-toolkit) by `esterTion` and all the endpoints used to grab the assets are from that repo as well, so big thanks to `esterTion` for making those available to the public.
